designed after the metaphor of cultivating a bonsai tree, bonsai is a "cultivatable" game engine -- one that grows through play & can be easily pruned by authors. authors start by "seeding" their game (writing as much as they'd like). the player interacts with the game in natural language, which will either get matched to a similar enough existing option ("run away" = "sneak out") or will lead to a new branch, generated in real-time. branches persist in the editor, which the author can edit and refine asynchronously. the system learns from edit behavior, extracting author preferences to improve its future generations.
